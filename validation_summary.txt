================================================================================
❌ REMOVED / CORRECTED DATA THAT WERE ESTIMATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Removed: Easter Holiday Factor (0.970*)
   Reason: Was estimated, not calculated from sufficient data
   Action: Marked as N/A in document

2. Corrected: Holiday Factor for "Other Public Holidays"
   Old: 0.980* (estimated)
   New: 0.975 (calculated from n=34 real days)

3. Removed: Mock Bayesian fusion weights (σ_AI, σ_Weather estimates)
   Reason: Not empirically validated
   Action: Documented as "Not independently calculated"

4. Corrected: Lunar New Year Factor
   Old: 0.75 (estimated -25% from literature)
   New: 0.940 (real -6.0% from n=33 days)

5. Removed: Generic calibration parameter references
   Old: "getCalibratedParameter('aqhi_severe')"
   New: Specific multipliers from real data (e.g., 0.951 for heavy rain)

6. Corrected: All weather adjustment multipliers
   Old: Generic tuning parameters
   New: Calculated from weather_impact_analysis.json real data
